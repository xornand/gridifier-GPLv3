# Gridifier-GPLv3: Async Responsive HTML Grids

### Documentation

A fork of the 2.0 Gridifier license. For the time being, the gridifier.io official website will likely have up-to-date documents. As far as I can tell, the 2.0.1 change was just a directory traversal with sed to swap GPLv3 into Creative Commons. 

### License

This is the last version of Gridifier released publically under the GPLv3.

It was later re-licensed as a dual (commerical + CC-CA or some such).

Growing up surrounded by academia open methods and publishing research was the standard moral framework under which I was raised. I'm a strong believer in GPL as a virus. A lot of people complain about the GPL because "oh no now I can't use it in my commercial product!". If that's the case, approach the engineers and negotiate a license to distribute his/her components in your commercial product. Presumably, his/her work is valuable enough to merit using in your product. Trust me, if you engineer it yourself, the overhead of labor, meetings, stupid comments from project managers et al will end up costing the company significantly more than just paying the engineer for a license, then another couple thousand a month for a few hours of support. Or you could simply just comply with the GPL advancing the overall field of software engineering.

For further reading, Zed Shaw articulates specifically why he uses the GPL [here](http://zedshaw.com/archive/why-i-algpl/). I'll throw in an editoral note myself, stand up on the soapbox, and say Mongrel made companies in aggregate of hundreds of millions of dollars during the "Ruby of the early 2000s". If it weren't for FreeBSD, tons of marketing and a pretty coat of paint, OS X wouldn't be prevalant. Go audit their financials. It's transparent. See [here](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/documents/2011%20Profit%20and%20Loss.pdf). Their net revenue for the _entire year_? ~221,000. Apple made more than that in [two minutes](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/01/28/by-the-numbers-apples-ludicrous-fourth-quarter).

I feel like a dick because I'm exploiting the ignorance of a small-startup just trying to launch what seems to be a pretty good product.

### Support

None, but feel free to contact me and I'll follow the [old-line etiquette](http://rurounijones.github.io/blog/2009/03/17/how-to-ask-for-help-on-irc/) of IRC. Hell, I may even work on a feature for free if it's interesting enough. Then make a commit and release it under the GPLv3 of course.
